## You Suffer
In Greek mythology, Sisyphus was the king of Ephyra. He was a scheming tyrant and believed that he was the shit. Unfortunately for Sisyphus', his existence predated the saying "snitches get stitches". Sisyphus snitched on the most powerful god in all history, Zeus. So, now the god of thunder is pissed and wants revenge. Zeus sends Sisyphus to die, but Sisyphus is a crafty bastard and escapes death twice. At this point, Zeus is not fucking around with Sisyphus anymore. Zeus decides death is not enough, he sentences Sisyphus to eternal punishment. Sisyphus must roll a massive boulder up a mountain, as he gets to the peak the boulder rolls back down and he must start again.

## Albert Camus
[Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus) believed that Sisyphus's story was an excellent metaphor for our lives. We wake up, go to work, go home, drink some beers, and pass out, only to repeat the same process for most of our lives. Eventually, we will die and be forgotten.

> "The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

Camus explains that Sisyphus is aware of his eternal struggle. He is still passionate about his life and has not given up. He takes joy in the torturous process. At the end of the day, he can always watch the boulder roll back down to the depths of hades. After all, who doesn't like to see a rock hauling ass?

## But Why?
It's not enough to just live life. We must live passionately and fully, aware and always questioning.

Smile as you push the boulder and embrace the futility of life.
