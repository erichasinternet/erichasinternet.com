## Why a static site?
Creating a static site is the best way to get started with your own personal website. Static sites are fast, secure, and inexpensive. My only expense is ~$12 a year for domain hosting!

## First, get a domain

* I use [Google Domains](https://domains.google/)
* [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com/) is also a great choice!

## Second, find hosting

* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) offers excellent static site hosting.
* [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) is my personal choice.

## Third, choose a static site generator
* I prefer [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) are also popular choices.

## That's it!
